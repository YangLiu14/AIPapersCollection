### Robotic Grasping of Novel Objects using Vision (2008)
Using 2 (or more) images of the target object to infer grasp location. Supervised training, ground truth is the image of the 3D object with human labeled grasp location indicated by different color.
This paper uses predefined edge and texture filter, did not use any neural networkds.
