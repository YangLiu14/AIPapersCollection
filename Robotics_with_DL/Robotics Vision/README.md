### Robotic Grasping of Novel Objects using Vision (2008)
- Using 2 (or more) images of the target object to infer grasp location. Supervised training, ground truth is the image of the 3D object with human labeled grasp location indicated by different color.
- This paper uses predefined edge and texture filter, did not use any neural networks.
- Motion plan: PRM planner.
